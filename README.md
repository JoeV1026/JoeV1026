## Hi, I'm Joseph VelasquezðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science with a deep passion for AI, research, and software engineering. Originally from New York, I moved to Georgia to pursue exciting research opportunities and further develop my technical skills. I have a relentless curiosity that drives me to explore new technologies, solve complex problems, and constantly seek ways to innovate.

I love immersing myself in challenging projects, applying new concepts, and bringing creative ideas to life. Whether it's working on AI-driven applications or optimizing systems, I thrive on turning abstract ideas into real-world solutions. Beyond academics, I enjoy exploring the city, making new friends, and playing the guitar.

I strongly believe in collaboration and am always open to brainstorming ideas and building impactful projects with like-minded individuals. If you're interested in working together or discussing an exciting concept, feel free to reach out. I'd love to connect!
